"Shopping List" is a simple mobile application that allows you to create and manage a list of products to buy. The app allows you to add products using the "Add product" button, delete individual products by long-pressing an item on the list, and clear the entire list of products using the second button. Thanks to integration with Firebase, the user has the ability to share their list with other people who have the same application. All data is automatically saved to the cloud and is available after the application is restarted.
This application is written in Java using the AndroidX framework and Firebase Realtime Database.
